Hi
================
Well, I've always wanted to make a blog. No idea what to say, but it's fun to build. Simple too, add a markdown file, commit the changes, and voila! a new post. Isn't CI/CD great? Maybe one day I'll make a post about it.

For now, if you're interested, check `.github/workflows` from this repo (or you know, from the homepage)
