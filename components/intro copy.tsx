    <p>
      Welcome to my website. I don't have too much to say, but I guess I felt I
      had enough to make a website, and well now I need to fill it with content.
      When you use your domain's catch-all to organize your inbox, you know
      people are going to come here out of intrest - or at least I would. There
      was a strong temptation to redirect users instead, but I guess I wanted an
      excuse to write some code.
    </p>
    <p>I like to code. I mean, I **really** like to code.</p>
    <p>
      You can check out the code for this very website
